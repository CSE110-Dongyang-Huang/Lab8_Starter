### 1)
Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is because it will save time by automatically run our code for testing. In this way, programmers can have more time writing code instead of repeatedly doing redundant testings.

### 2)
No.

### 3)
No. The "read" and "write" properties among users cause interactions. It would potentially trigger a larger and complicated scale of errors. It is hard to handle these cases. So, it is not a good way to perform a unit test.

### 4)
Yes. This is because we only need to check if the user input size is greater than 80 or not, regardless of other interactions. Thus, it is a good way to use a unit test.
